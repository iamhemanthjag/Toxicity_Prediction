## Toxicity Predicition Challenge II:
We have participated in the Toxicity Perdiction Challenge II on Kaggle as a part of our CSCI 555 Data Mining and Machine learning Project.I used machine learning algorithms to create a model which predicts whether the given chemical is toxic or not. 

This is an exciting competition addressing a real-life challenge. use machine learning to create a model that predicts which chemicals are toxic.


With new chemicals being synthesized every day, toxicity prediction of newly synthesized chemicals is mandatory before they could be released in the market. For a long time, *in-vivo* methods have been used for toxicity prediction which involves studying bacteria, human cells, or animals. With thousands of new chemicals being synthesized every day, it is not feasible to detect toxicity with traditional laboratory animal testing. One great alternative for *in-vivo *methods is the *in-silico* techniques that have great potential to reduce time, cost, and animal testing involved in detecting toxicity. ToxCast dataset is one of the greatest data available in the field of toxicogenomics. ToxCast has data for approximately 9,000 chemicals with more than 1500 high-throughput assay endpoints that cover a range of high-level cell responses.


## Execution of code: 
I executed my code jupyter notebook and uploaded the submission file on kaggle. I used the test and train files provided in CSV format for the competition.

## Steps to execute code in jupyter notebook: 
1. Open-source code provided (.ipynb format) in the jupyter notebook. 
2. Upload the train, test in the jupyter notebook OR Change the train, test address in the code by mentioning their current location in the system. 
3. Save and Run the code. 
 
Using Google Colab Notebook, we can convert it to .py extension and use the file for execution. 

Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamhemanthjag/Toxicity_Prediction.git
```
Start Execution

``` bash
HJ.ipynb
```
